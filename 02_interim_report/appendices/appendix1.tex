\chapter{Model Derivation for a Single Area Power System}
When looking at a single area power system, there are three main components that the literature has a tendency to focus on:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Governor:} used for controlling the angular velocity (and frequency) of the system;
	\item \textbf{Turbine:} this is the steam turbine which provides the mechanical torque to drive the generator; and
	\item \textbf{Generator load:} describes the electrical power that is produced and the electrical torque from connected loads. 
\end{enumerate}
