\section{Generator Load Model}
If the turbine output is in some steady state, and the power system experiences some perturbation, then let the incremental power from the turbine be $\Delta P_G$. Noting that the main perturbation experienced by a power system is the change in load demand, $\Delta P_L$, the incremental input to the generator-load system is given by $\Delta P_G - \Delta P_L$.

The increment in power input to the system is accounted for in two ways:
\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item Rate of increase of stored kinetic energy in the generator rotor. At scheduled frequency $f_0$, the stored energy is:
	\begin{equation}
		(W_{ke})_0 = H \times P_r,
	\end{equation}
	where $P_r$ is the kilowatt rating of the turbo-generator and $H$ is defined as it's inertial constant. Given that the kinetic energy is proportional to the square of the speed (frequency), the kinetic energy at a frequency of $f_0 + \Delta f$ can be written as:
	\begin{equation}
		W_{ke} = (W_{ke})_0 \bigg( \frac{f_0 + \Delta f}{f_0} \bigg)^2 \approx H P_r \bigg( 1 + \frac{2\Delta f}{f_0} \bigg)
	\end{equation}
	
	The rate of change of kinetic energy is therefore:
	\begin{equation}
		\frac{d}{dt}(W_{ke}) = \frac{2 H P_r}{f_0} \frac{d}{dt} (\Delta f) \label{eq:A11}
	\end{equation}
	
	\item Given that motors make up a reasonable percentage of the load demand it must be considered that the motor load changes as the frequency changes. The rate of change of load with respect to frequency, $\frac{\partial P_L}{\partial f}$, can be considered constant for small changes in frequency $\Delta f$ and can be expressed as:
	\begin{equation}
		\frac{\partial P_L}{\partial f} \Delta f = B \Delta f \label{eq:A12},
	\end{equation}
	where $B$ can be empirically determined, and is dependent on the proportion of motors that comprise the load demand. Note that is $B$ is positive, then the the load is predominantly comprised of motors.
\end{enumerate}

Using equations \ref{eq:A11} and \ref{eq:A12}, the power balance equation for the incremental input to the generator-load system can be written as:
\begin{equation}
	\Delta P_G - \Delta P_L = \frac{2 H P_r}{f_0} \frac{d}{dt} (\Delta f) + B \Delta f
\end{equation}

Dividing throughout by $P_r$ yields the following:
\begin{equation}
	\Delta P_G(pu) - \Delta P_L(pu) = \frac{2 H}{f_0} \frac{d}{dt} (\Delta f) + B(pu) \Delta f \label{eq:A13}
\end{equation}

Taking the Laplace transform of equation \ref{eq:A13} and rearranging, we get the following expression:
\begin{equation}
	\Delta F(s) = \frac{\Delta P_G(s) - \Delta P_L(s)}{B + \frac{2H}{f_0}s} \label{eq:A14}
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{eq:A14} can re-expressed as:
\begin{equation}
	\Delta F(s) = [\Delta P_G(s) - \Delta P_L(s)] \times \bigg( \frac{K_{gl}}{1 + T_{gl}} \bigg), \label{eq:A15}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{align}
K_{gl} &= \frac{1}{B} \\
T_{gl} &= \frac{2H}{B f_0}
\end{align}

Equation \ref{eq:A15} is the model of the generator-load in the frequency domain. The parameter $K_{gl}$ is referred to as the gain of the generator load; and the parameter $T_{gl}$ is referred to as the time constant of the generator load.
