\section{Main Experiments}
Two principal experiments will be undertaken to determine the feasibility of using a neural network to control the frequency and power interchange for a two area power system.

%---------------- S: Real World Load Demand

\subsection{Real World Load Demand}
A DDPG agent would be trained using real world load demand data sourced from a utility provider. The volume of data required to successfully train the DDPG agent will depend on the duration of time for episodic simulation, and sampling rate of the utility load demand data. A week of utility load demand data at a high sampling frequency would be adequate using simulation episodes of 30 sec for example.

Trained DDPG agent performance will be compared to optimally tuned PI controller, for an unseen stochastic load profile.


%---------------- S: Introduction of Non-linearity

\subsection{Modelling Non-linearity}
Non-linearity such as governor dead band and generator ramping constraints will be introduced to the two-area power system model. DDPG agent will be trained on a simple step function to assess initial performance compared to an optimally tuned PI controller. Time permitting the experiment will be repeated using stochastic load demand profiles.
