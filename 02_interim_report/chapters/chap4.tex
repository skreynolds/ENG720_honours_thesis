\chapter{Approach}
The approach is broken up into three phases, undertaken sequentially. The first phase focuses on model development and implementation of the power system environment, proportional integral controller, and the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) agent. The second phase undertakes preliminary investigations of simulation system settings and DDPG hyperparameters to understand DDPG power system control feasibility. Finally, The third phase conducts experiments on both the DDPG and PI controller capacity to cope with stochastic load demand profiles, and non-linear plant.
