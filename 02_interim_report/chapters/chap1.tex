\chapter{Introduction}
In 2018, approximately 261$\si{\tera\watt\hour}$ of power was generated in the Australian electricity sector. Renewables contributed 19\% of the total generation, an increase from 15\% in 2017. The Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources have observed an increase in renewable energy generation year-on-year in the electricity generation market since 2008, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:energyts} \cite{Diser2020}.\\

One of the benefits of transitioning from thermal sources of power generation to renewable sources is reduced greenhouse gas emissions \cite{IPCC2012}; however, this transition is not without its drawbacks. With an increased reliance on renewable power generation sources posing challenges for power system stability owing to load management. A recent example is the system failure in Alice Springs, caused by an event cascade that was triggered by cloud cover shadowing a solar array. The system failure left residents in Alice Springs without power for approximately eight hours \cite{UCNT2019}. An independent investigation highlighted that poor control policies were one of the factors that contributed to the blackout. In this instance, the generator provisioned to ramp up in the event of cloud cover was unable to be controlled. Moreover, generators that were still under the control regime were issued operating set points above their rated capacity, that resulted in thermal overload and subsequent tripping from the protection system \cite{Wilkey2019}.

Current control methods use classical feedback loop techniques. These methods can be brittle when faced with system changes, or scenarios which they were not designed for. An improved controller would be one that can learn and adapt its controller to an unseen system or event, given some broad control objective. This research proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent for controlling the frequency of a power system consisting of multiple generators, and multiple load demands with individual stochastic profiles.

\section{Research Aim}
The principle aim of this research is to compare the performance of known, optimised feedback loop controller architectures against a DRL based control system when tasked with performing load following ancillary services with regulating generators under AGC for a two area power system. This research will be undertaken in order to understand the feasibility of using DRL agents for two area power system management.
