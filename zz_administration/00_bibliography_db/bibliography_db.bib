  abstract = {This paper formulates the automatic generation control (AGC) problem as a stochastic multistage decision problem. A strategy for solving this new AGC problem formulation is presented by using a reinforcement learning (RL) approach. This method of obtaining an AGC controller does not depend on any knowledge of the system model and more importantly it admits considerable flexibility in defining the control objective. Two specific RL based AGC algorithms are presented. The first algorithm uses the traditional control objective of limiting area control error (ACE) excursions, where as, in the second algorithm, the controller can restore the load-generation balance by only monitoring deviation in tie line flows and system frequency and it does not need to know or estimate the composite ACE signal as is done by all current approaches. The effectiveness and versatility of the approaches has been demonstrated using a two area AGC model.},

In this setting LFC is formulated as a tracking problem in which energy source dynamics and load following play a central role. It is shown how load prediction and coordination of area generation in a multi-area interconnection can effectively improve the regulation of inter-area power flows.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an application of layered artificial neural network controller (ANN) to study automatic generation control (AGC) problem in a four-area interconnected power system that three areas include steam turbines and the other area includes a hydro turbine. Each area of steam turbine in the system contains the reheat effect non-linearity of the steam turbine and the area of hydro turbine contains upper and lower constraints for generation rate. Only one ANN controller, which controls the inputs of each area in the power system together, is considered. In the study, back propagation-through-time algorithm is used as ANN learning rule. By comparing the results for both cases, the performance of ANN controller is better than conventional controllers.},

The paper presents a study of two steam-electric power areas connected via tie-line.

The main conclusions are that:

more stable and rapid control responses are obtainable with a tie line power frequency bias control;

optimum tie-line power and frequency regulator gains depend only slightly on relative strength of tie-line;

optimum frequency-controller gain on an area is inverse to system-speed regulation of the area;

the principal factor affecting max frequency deviation is effective speed-governor droop; and 

optimum frequency and tie-line power gains are greater that those used in power system controllers at the time the paper was published},

This paper differs from much previous work in the respect that the assumption that the system be linear is not made. A numerical method is presented to solve for the nonlinear system. The linear case can be treated as a degenerate case of the more difficult problem. Since it is possible to find an exact solution for a linear system, examples are presented to show good agreement between the exact solution and the solution obtained by the numerical method.},

This is considered as one of the main underlying problems associated with VSC. The proposed method provides an optimal and systematic way of feedback gains selection in the VSC. To test the effectiveness of the new selection method, the proposed design has been applied to the load frequency problem of a single area power system. The system performance against step load variations has been simulated and compared to some previous methods, Simulation results show that not only the dynamic system performance has been improved, but also the control effort is dramatically reduced.},
  comment  = {Variable structure control (VSC) is a form of discontinuous nonlinear control. The method alters the dynamics of a nonlinear system by application of a high-frequency switching control. The state-feedback control law is not a continuous function of time; it switches from one smooth condition to another. So the structure of the control law varies based on the position of the state trajectory; the method switches from one smooth control law to another and possibly very fast speeds (e.g., for a countably infinite number of times in a finite time interval).

Study was conducted on a single control area system.},

The second controller has a simpler structure, which is more appealing from an implementation point of view, and it is tuned by a proposed novel robust control design algorithm to achieve the same robust performance as the first one. More specifically, genetic algorithms (GAs) optimization is used to tune the control parameters of the proportional-integral (PI) controller subject to the H/sub /spl infin// constraints in terms of LMI. Hence, the second control design is called GALMI. Both proposed controllers are tested on a three-area power system with three scenarios of load disturbances to demonstrate their robust performances.},

Though it is well known that the normal PID control is usually superior to integral control because of the advantages of each of the three individual control actions (proportional, integral and derivative), the author’s contribution in the paper is optimizing these individual PID gains through GA or GA-SA methods to obtain an optimal PID controller, which would be further better than an optimal integral controller. These optimal PID gains are tested by plotting transient responses analytically by MATLAB based software program and then by “SIMULINK of MATLAB software.” Both methods yield same results and prove that optimal PID gains are superior to suboptimal, arbitrary PID gains and optimal integral gains as well with respect to transient responses. The author’s next contribution is to show optimal PID gains as determined by hybrid GA-SA technique to be more globally optimal than those determined by GA method. For off-nominal input parameters, transient responses as determined by fast acting Sugeno fuzzy logic technique reflect the same superiority of GA-SA based optimized gains, specially for PID control, the same has also been verified by “MATLAB–SIMULINK” software.},
  comment  = {The paper creates a controller with optimal integral gains and optimal PID gains using GA and then again using GA-SA (genetic algorithm-simulating annealing). The gains are utilised by Sugeno fuzzy logic to provide optimal performance for varying off-normal input parameters.

The paper concluded that both GA and GA-SA perform better than fixed gain controls, and that GA-SA is better than GA for finding globally optimal control schemes.},

  abstract = {In this paper, various novel heuristic stochastic search techniques have been proposed for optimization of proportional–integral–derivative gains used in Sugeno fuzzy logic based automatic generation control of multi-area thermal generating plants. The techniques are classical particle swarm optimization, hybrid particle swarm optimizations and hybrid genetic algorithm simulated annealing. Numerical results show that all optimization techniques are more or less equally very effective in yielding optimal transient responses of area frequency and tie-line power flow deviations. The gains obtained by particle swarm optimization are more optimal than those obtained by GA/hybrid GA-simulated annealing. Particle swarm optimizations take the least time to achieve the same optimal gains. These gains are for nominal system parameters. For varying off-nominal on-line system parameters, fast acting Sugeno fuzzy logic manipulates the nominal gains adaptively to determine transient responses.},

  abstract    = {Power system emergency control is generally regarded as the last safety net for grid security and resiliency. Existing emergency control schemes are usually designed off-line based on either the conceived "worst" case scenario or a few typical operation scenarios. These schemes are facing significant adaptiveness and robustness issues as increasing uncertainties and variations occur in modern electrical grids. To address these challenges, for the first time, this paper developed novel adaptive emergency control schemes using deep reinforcement learning (DRL), by leveraging the high-dimensional feature extraction and non-linear generalization capabilities of DRL for complex power systems. Furthermore, an open-source platform named RLGC has been designed for the first time to assist the development and benchmarking of DRL algorithms for power system control. Details of the platform and DRL-based emergency control schemes for generator dynamic braking and under-voltage load shedding are presented. Extensive case studies performed in both two-area four-machine system and IEEE 39-Bus system have demonstrated the excellent performance and robustness of the proposed schemes.},

A single generator unit feeds a power line to various users whose power demand can vary over time. As a consequence of load variations, the frequency of the generator changes over time. A feedforward neural network is trained to control the steam admission valve of the turbine that drives the generator, thereby restoring the frequency to its nominal value. Frequency transients are minimized and zero steady-state error is obtained. The same technique is then applied to control a system composed of two single units tied together through a power line. Electric load variations can happen independently in both units. Both neural controllers are trained with the back propagation-through-time algorithm. Use of a neural network to model the dynamic system is avoided by introducing the Jacobian matrices of the system in the back propagation chain used in controller training.},

Simple neural networks which are in common use at present have various drawbacks like large training time, requirement of large number of neurons, etc. The present work deals with the development of a non-linear neural network controller using a generalised neural network.

In order to take large modeling errors and minimize the effects of area load disturbances, the idea of μ-synthesis theory is being used for training ANN based LFC controller. This newly developed design strategy combines advantage of the ANN and μ-synthesis control techniques to achieve the desired level of robust performance for all admissible uncertainties and leads to a flexible controller with relatively simple structure, which can be useful in the real world complex power system. A two-area power system is considered as a test system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with the conventional PI and μ-based robust controllers under various operating conditions and load changes. The simulation results show that the proposed ANN based controller achieves good robust performance even in the presence of generation rate constraints (GRC) and is superior to the other controllers.},

The control environments to be tackled include the well-known n-armed bandit problem, and the adaptive controller comprises an ensemble of n-armed bandit controllers, suitably interconnected. The design of these constituent elements is not discussed.

  abstract  = {In this article, we describe a method for optimizing control policies, with guaranteed monotonic improvement. By making several approximations to the theoretically-justified scheme, we develop a practical algorithm, called Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO). This algorithm is effective for optimizing large nonlinear policies such as neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate its robust performance on a wide variety of tasks: learning simulated robotic swimming, hopping, and walking gaits; and playing Atari games using images of the screen as input. Despite its approximations that deviate from the theory, TRPO tends to give monotonic improvement, with little tuning of hyperparameters.},

The deterministic policy gradient has a particularly appealing form: it is the expected gradient of the action-value function. This simple form means that the deterministic policy gradient can be estimated much more efficiently than the usual stochastic policy gradient. To ensure adequate exploration, we introduce an off-policy actor-critic algorithm that learns a deterministic target policy from an exploratory behaviour policy. Deterministic policy gradient algorithms outperformed their stochastic counterparts in several benchmark problems, particularly in high-dimensional action spaces.},

  abstract    = {Policy gradient methods in reinforcement learning have become increasingly prevalent for state-of-the-art performance in continuous control tasks. Novel methods typically benchmark against a few key algorithms such as deep deterministic policy gradients and trust region policy optimization. As such, it is important to present and use consistent baselines experiments. However, this can be difficult due to general variance in the algorithms, hyper-parameter tuning, and environment stochasticity. We investigate and discuss: the significance of hyper-parameters in policy gradients for continuous control, general variance in the algorithms, and reproducibility of reported results. We provide guidelines on reporting novel results as comparisons against baseline methods such that future researchers can make informed decisions when investigating novel methods.},
