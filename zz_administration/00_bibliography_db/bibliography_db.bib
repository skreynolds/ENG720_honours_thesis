  abstract = {This paper formulates the automatic generation control (AGC) problem as a stochastic multistage decision problem. A strategy for solving this new AGC problem formulation is presented by using a reinforcement learning (RL) approach. This method of obtaining an AGC controller does not depend on any knowledge of the system model and more importantly it admits considerable flexibility in defining the control objective. Two specific RL based AGC algorithms are presented. The first algorithm uses the traditional control objective of limiting area control error (ACE) excursions, where as, in the second algorithm, the controller can restore the load-generation balance by only monitoring deviation in tie line flows and system frequency and it does not need to know or estimate the composite ACE signal as is done by all current approaches. The effectiveness and versatility of the approaches has been demonstrated using a two area AGC model.},

Each area of steam turbine in the system contains the reheat effect non-linearity of the steam turbine and the area of hydro turbine contains upper and lower constraints for generation rate. Only one ANN controller, which controls the inputs of each area in the power system together, is considered. In the study, back propagation-through-time algorithm is used as ANN learning rule. By comparing the results for both cases, the performance of ANN controller is better than conventional controllers.},

This is considered as one of the main underlying problems associated with VSC. The proposed method provides an optimal and systematic way of feedback gains selection in the VSC. To test the effectiveness of the new selection method, the proposed design has been applied to the load frequency problem of a single area power system. The system performance against step load variations has been simulated and compared to some previous methods, Simulation results show that not only the dynamic system performance has been improved, but also the control effort is dramatically reduced.},

The state-feedback control law is not a continuous function of time; it switches from one smooth condition to another. So the structure of the control law varies based on the position of the state trajectory; the method switches from one smooth control law to another and possibly very fast speeds (e.g., for a countably infinite number of times in a finite time interval).

Though it is well known that the normal PID control is usually superior to integral control because of the advantages of each of the three individual control actions (proportional, integral and derivative), the author’s contribution in the paper is optimizing these individual PID gains through GA or GA-SA methods to obtain an optimal PID controller, which would be further better than an optimal integral controller. These optimal PID gains are tested by plotting transient responses analytically by MATLAB based software program and then by “SIMULINK of MATLAB software.” Both methods yield same results and prove that optimal PID gains are superior to suboptimal, arbitrary PID gains and optimal integral gains as well with respect to transient responses. The author’s next contribution is to show optimal PID gains as determined by hybrid GA-SA technique to be more globally optimal than those determined by GA method. For off-nominal input parameters, transient responses as determined by fast acting Sugeno fuzzy logic technique reflect the same superiority of GA-SA based optimized gains, specially for PID control, the same has also been verified by “MATLAB–SIMULINK” software.},

Existing emergency control schemes are usually designed off-line based on either the conceived "worst" case scenario or a few typical operation scenarios. These schemes are facing significant adaptiveness and robustness issues as increasing uncertainties and variations occur in modern electrical grids. To address these challenges, for the first time, this paper developed novel adaptive emergency control schemes using deep reinforcement learning (DRL), by leveraging the high-dimensional feature extraction and non-linear generalization capabilities of DRL for complex power systems. Furthermore, an open-source platform named RLGC has been designed for the first time to assist the development and benchmarking of DRL algorithms for power system control. Details of the platform and DRL-based emergency control schemes for generator dynamic braking and under-voltage load shedding are presented. Extensive case studies performed in both two-area four-machine system and IEEE 39-Bus system have demonstrated the excellent performance and robustness of the proposed schemes.},

A feedforward neural network is trained to control the steam admission valve of the turbine that drives the generator, thereby restoring the frequency to its nominal value. Frequency transients are minimized and zero steady-state error is obtained. The same technique is then applied to control a system composed of two single units tied together through a power line. Electric load variations can happen independently in both units. Both neural controllers are trained with the back propagation-through-time algorithm. Use of a neural network to model the dynamic system is avoided by introducing the Jacobian matrices of the system in the back propagation chain used in controller training.},

  abstract = {Recent research into the mechanisms of evolution and genetics has shown how biological systems have managed to develop some very powerful methods of optimising and adapting themselves to meet new environmental challenges. For applications in control systems engineering, many of the characteristics exhibited by genetic algorithms are particularly appropriate. They can be used as an optimization tool or as the basis of adaptive systems. The versatile and robust qualities of these algorithms are reviewed and their relevance for control systems is highlighted. Applications are described and implementation issues are addressed, including parallelization. Prospective future directions are identified},

  abstract = {It is shown that a neural network can learn of its own accord to control a nonlinear dynamic system. An emulator, a multilayered neural network, learns to identify the system's dynamic characteristics. The controller, another multilayered neural network, next learns to control the emulator. The self-trained controller is then used to control the actual dynamic system. The learning process continues as the emulator and controller improve and track the physical process. An example is given to illustrate these ideas. The 'truck backer-upper', a neural network controller that steers a trailer truck while the truck is backing up to a loading dock, is demonstrated. The controller is able to guide the truck to the dock from almost any initial position. The technique explored should be applicable to a wide variety of nonlinear control problems.},

The proposed method can nonlinearly derive control strategies to minimize frequency deviation with faster response speed and stronger adaptability for unmolded system dynamics. It consists of offline optimization of LFC strategies with DRL and continuous action search, and online control with policy network where features are extracted by stacked denoising auto-encoders. Numerical simulations verify the effectiveness and advantages of proposed method over existing approaches.},

  abstract  = {This paper focuses on choosing a suitable dynamic model for simulation of generation rate constraint (GRC) for load frequency control (LFC) of an interconnected realistic reheat thermal-thermal power system. Two different dynamic models for simulation of the GRC are investigated in details which are named as open loop and closed loop GRC models. These models have been used widely in literature interchangeably without any further description to the reason of selected modeling method and its suitability. This paper makes an attempt to help in choosing more effective and appropriate GRC structure pertained to reheat thermal units based on dynamic simulations to obtain optimal LFC. Reheat thermal units are examined with different GRC models. Then, integral of time multiplied squared error (ITSE) performance index is minimized by an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm to optimize proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller parameters. All simulations are performed in MATLAB/SIMULINK environment. The results of eigenvalue analysis, dynamic simulations, and robustness analysis reveal the appropriate GRC modeling method for thermal units to attain high-performance and optimal LFC design.},

  abstract = {This paper describes an adaptive controller for discrete-time stochastic environments. The controller receives the environment's current state and a reward signal which indicates the desirability of that state. In response, it selects an appropriate control action and notes its effect. The cycle repeats indefinitely. The control environments to be tackled include the well-known n-armed bandit problem, and the adaptive controller comprises an ensemble of n-armed bandit controllers, suitably interconnected. The design of these constituent elements is not discussed. It is shown that, under certain conditions, the controller's actions eventually become optimal for the particular control task with which it is faced, in the sense that they maximize the expected reward obtained in the future.},
