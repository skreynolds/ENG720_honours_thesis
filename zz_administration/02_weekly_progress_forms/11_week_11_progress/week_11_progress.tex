	%-------------- Sections
	\section{Progress since last meeting}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Finalised implementation of environment in OpenAI class structure
		\item Implemented DDPG controller class, and Pytorch neural network models
		\item Conducted 11 experiments modifying DDPG hyperparameters and reward function to train the model effectively
		\item Discovered that the reward function is an important factor in the agent's ability to learn effectively --- a simpler reward function is better
		\item Discovered that the OU noise process used for state-action space discovery can be detrimental to agent learning --- reduced noise signal improves agent learning for this problem domain
		\item Researched a decaying noise process that may improve learning further (have not yet implemented)
		\item Research prioritised replay buffer may improve learning (have not implemented yet)
		\item Discovered that the problem environment is very unstable and highly sensitive to control actions --- learning is improved by clipping the magnitudes of the control actions.
		\item Worked on and completed poster
	\end{itemize}
	\section{Discussion Points}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item CY provided feedback on poster for SR to implement
		\item Discussed research and interim report
	\end{itemize}
	\section{Plan until the next meeting}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Submit poster
		\item Finalise interim report
	\end{itemize}
