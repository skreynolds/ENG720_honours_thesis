	\section{Progress since last meeting}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Minor changes to literatures review
		\item Found a second year PhD student at research group at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore who is undertaking the same research. The link to the research group is \href{https://eexuyan.github.io/soda/index.html}{here}. The student recently published a paper in IEEE which mentions it is very difficult to train a neural network to control the frequency of a multiarea power system using DDPG from scratch. The student instead captured data, in simulation, of tuned PID frequency control of a two area power system. The data was then used to pre-train the neural network using a supervised learning approach. This provided the model with a starting point. DDPG was then used on the pre-trained model to optimise further - the results show that the DDPG optimised neural network controller outperforms PID.
	\end{itemize}
	\section{Discussion Points}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Meeting did not occur this week
	\end{itemize}
	\section{Plan until the next meeting}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Run experiment for 20000 episodes to see if model performance improves with additional training
		\item Implement priority experience replay to see if there are additional gains in agent performance
		\item Investigate how a supervised learning might be implemented to pre-train the model
	\end{itemize}
