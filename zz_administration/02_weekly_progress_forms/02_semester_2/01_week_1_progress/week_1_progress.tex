	%-------------- Sections
	\section{Progress since last meeting}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Completed interim report
		\item Reduced the amount of training done per episode, reducing the training time for each episode
		Undertook more preliminary testing of model architecture and DDPG parameters
		\item Re-wrote preliminary experiments chapter to provide a more structured and scientific approach. Presented findings in a clearer and more concise manner
	\end{itemize}
	\section{Discussion Points}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item CY advised to proceed with completion of thesis
		\item SR advised that results of DDPG are approaching the performance of PID; however, do not seem to be able to match or exceed PID performance. SR advised that there are still some avenues to explore that might yield better results
		\item CY advised that research needs to move away from simulation and match real world scenario
	\end{itemize}
	\section{Plan until the next meeting}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Approach PWC or TGEN to determine real world parameters and real world load data
		\item Determine a clear experimental methodology for main research experiments
		\item Continue writing thesis
	\end{itemize}
