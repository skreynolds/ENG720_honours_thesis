	%-------------- Sections
	\section{Progress since last meeting}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Updated reinforcement learning section in background, including main algorithms used to derive DDPG algorithm
		\item Updated deep neural networks section in background
		\item Created Appendix A to detail modelling derivations for governor, turbine, and generator-load
		\item Created Appendix B to detail modelling for tie line and tie-line feedback connections
		\item Created drawings for reinforcement learning, deep neural networks, and two area power system
		\item Developed and simulated stochastic load profile demand signal on classical controllers
		\item Developed and tested iterative approach using ode integration for single area pi control
	\end{itemize}
	\section{Discussion Points}
	\begin{itemize}
