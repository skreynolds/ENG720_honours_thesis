	%-------------- Sections
	\section{Progress since last meeting}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Continuing to revise and work on literature review. Have included additional sections on Reinforcement Learning, Neural Networks, and Deep Reinforcement Learning to provide adequate background to present approach and experiments.
		\item Implementing test versions of DRL learning algorithms on classical control problems --- emphasis on DDPG for continuous action spaces
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Discussion Points}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Nothing to discuss at this point in time --- need continue writing (discussion of draft thesis would be more beneficial the following Wednesday)
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Plan until the next meeting}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Complete thesis chapter Introduction
		\item Complete thesis chapter Literature Review
		\item Write thesis chapter on Approach
		\item Encapsulate power system model in OpenAI gym class environment and test to ensure that this works appropriately
		\item Implement classical controller for OpenAI gym class power system environment
		\item Implement DDPG controller for power system and train agent
		\item Test agent on unseen scenarios
		\item Commence thesis chapter on experiments
	\end{itemize}
