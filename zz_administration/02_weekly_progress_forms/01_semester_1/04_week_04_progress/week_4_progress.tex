	%-------------- Sections
	\section{Progress since last meeting}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Updates and submission of literature review
		\item Creation of static reference list and email to Charles
		\item Week 4 Research workshop completion
		\item Online Plagiarism test completed to 100\%
		\item Developed preliminary models for single area power system using P, and PI control. Implemented using MATLAB --- models successfully created and results verified against existing classical control papers for LFC
		\item Developed preliminary models for two area power system using P, and PI control. Implemented using MATLAB --- models successfully created and results verified against existing classical control papers for LFC
	\end{itemize}
	\section{Discussion Points}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Provided Charles with update on current progress
		\item Charles to provide feedback on research proposal. Key items of feedback include:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Shane to ensure documents are not too long (write concisely)
			\item Ensure that MS Project is used to create Gantt charts --- additional detail like number of days would be useful
			\item Shane to ensure that real world data is obtained from a utility for training DRL model (Charles emphasised importance of this point)
			\item  Shane to ensure that proper consideration is given to alternative control methods for the LFC/AGC control problem --- research proposal only considered classical approaches
			\item Shane has yet to contact Mark Howard from TGEN (or other contact from PWC)
		\end{itemize} 
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Plan until the next meeting}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Develop MATLAB control model mentioned above in a Python environment --- try to replicate the simulation results (if this can be achieved then it will be easier to work with Open AI DRL software architectures)
		\item Continue to refine literature review
		\item Make contact with Mark Howard from TGEN (and contact from PWC) to secure load profile data for DRL model training
	\end{itemize}
