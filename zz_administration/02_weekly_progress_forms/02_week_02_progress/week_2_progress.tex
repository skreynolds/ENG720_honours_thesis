	\section{Progress since last meeting}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Research proposal has been iterated on a number of times providing refinement.
		\item Reached out to TGEN to try and secured timeseries data sets for training DRL agent.
		\item Secured a contact at TGEN and some preliminary information on available datasets.
		\item Reached out to DIgSilent to acquire Power Factory demonstration software.
		\item Applied to DIgSilent online form to acquire a demonstration copy of Power Factory.
		\item Completed Week 1 Research Skills Workshop
