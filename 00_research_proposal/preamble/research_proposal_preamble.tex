%-------------------- Bibliography
\usepackage[backend=biber,style=ieee]{biblatex}
% This is the package that lets you create a bibliography. I recommend reading the biblatex documentation to understand all the options i've specified here. BibLaTeX was created to replace BibTeX. It has lots of extra fields and options. I'm also using the biber backend here rather than the default, it copes with unicode and so can deal with accented characters easily.

% Currently this is set up to use RSC style references with article titles displayed. You can change this to another numeric style, there are other numeric styles available: Vancouver, american chemical society, american institute of physics, etc. As well, there are author-date styles available. Most journals or styles you can think of are available and you're not restricted to use any particular referencing style at CDU. Royal society of Chemistry is just what I use. I'd recommend you talk to your supervisor about what referencing style to use, usually one that is common in your chosen field.

% Traditionally you would use BibTeX, a special build of TeX, for your bibliogrpahy.The newer biblatex package is a more powerful bibliograpy management tool for LaTeX. You can make multiple, chapter based bibliographies, footnote bibliographes, sort your references by date, author, order cited, essentially by any bit of citation data you happen to have. You can also have a seperate library with a differnet format for say books and articles. Or if you're a PhD student, the thesis references and your a list of YOUR publications. That siad. If you want to use the old way this is it below.

%-------------------- Hyperlinks in your document.
\usepackage[unicode=true,colorlinks=true,linkcolor=black,citecolor=black,urlcolor=black,breaklinks=true]{hyperref}
% The hyperref package allows you to have clickable links in your pdf. It also allows you to have the mailto link associated with your name. It can be  a bit finicky, so load it last.

%\usepackage[hyphens]{url}
% package used to properly specify

%-------------------- Command renewals, New commands etc.
\renewcommand{\thefootnote}{\alph{footnote}}              
%letters for footnotes instead of numbers to avoid confusion with references.

%-------------------- Function to create a small title block
\newcommand{\namelistlabel}[1]{\mbox{#1}\hfil}
\newenvironment{namelist}[1]{%1
\begin{list}{}
