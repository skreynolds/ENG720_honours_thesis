\section{Research Aims}
The principle aim of this research is to compare the performance of classical engineering control methodologies against a control system based on a DRL agent, when tasked with performing AGC for load following tasks on a two area power system. The ultimate research outcome will be to provide comment on the feasibility of using DRL agents for this purpose.
