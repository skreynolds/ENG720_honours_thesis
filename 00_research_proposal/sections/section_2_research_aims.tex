\section{Research Aims}
The principle aim of this research is to compare the performance of known, optimised feedback loop controller architectures against a DRL based control system when tasked with performing load following ancillary services with regulating generators under AGC for a two area power system. This research will be undertaken in order to understand the feasibility of using DRL agents for two area power system management.
