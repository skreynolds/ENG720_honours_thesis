\section{Research Aims}
The principle aim of this research is to compare the performance of known engineering control methodologies against a control system based on a DRL agent, when tasked with performing a load following task on a two area power system. This research will be undertaken in order to understand the feasibility of using DRL agents for two area power system management.
