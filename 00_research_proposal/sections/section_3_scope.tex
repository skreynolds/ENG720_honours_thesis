\section{Scope}
The proposed research focuses DRL agent performance against the task of load following by maintaining system frequency within PWC's allowable region of 49.80$\si{\hertz}$ to 50.20$\si{\hertz}$ for normal operating conditions. Time permitting, agent performance against the task of frequency restoration following a disturbance event may be considered. The key performance aspects that will assessed are the controller's ability to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item maintain system frequency to the desired nominal 50$\si{\hertz}$ value;
	\item maintain the tie line power flow between control areas at the scheduled value.
\end{itemize}

The research will not consider power systems larger than a two area power system, nor will it consider the control of system variables other than frequency. Note, however, other system variables may be used as input features under agent training and inference regimes. Comparison of DRL agent performance will be made against theoretical models of classical control architectures. Performance against control architectures implemented in practice will not be considered. Research will be conducted in an entirely simulated environment, and agent performance on real hardware will not be explored.
