\section{Deliverables Specification}
The main outcomes from this research is a conclusion about the feasibility of using DRL agents to provide AGC for a two area power system. The expectation is that the DRL agent will perform at least as well as a classical control approach. This expectation is based on the existing research in this field, which has shown that standard RL agents can perform AGC at least as well as classical control methods \cite{Ahamed2002}. If the research meets expectations, it should provide a pathway for the investigation of novel DRL models that could improve power system control. The ultimate goal would be to have a DRL agent that is always learning, so that it can adapt control strategies to unseen system conditions providing a more flexible and less brittle controller. This would help to avoid problems like that seen in the Alice Springs system blackout event.
