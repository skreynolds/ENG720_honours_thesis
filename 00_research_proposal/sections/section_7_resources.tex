\section{Resources}
The main research objectives, at a minimum, will require a computer with a Linux operating system, RAM, and a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). The exact specifications of these computational resources are not yet known, and will be dependent on the size of the datasets, and the amount of computation required to optimise the the DRL agent's cost function. Currently, access has been provided to an Intel Quad Core 3.2$\si{\giga\hertz}$ i5 CPU machine with 8GB of RAM, Nvidia GTX960 GPU, and Ubuntu operating system. Most likely these resources will suffice, however, in the event that greater computational power is needed, access to a high end virtualised Amazon Web Services (AWS) system set up to conduct DRL research will be required. Currently, such an instance has been provisioned on an existing AWS account and is currently deactivated to avoid cost. Using such a system can be expensive (1 hour of compute is approximately 20AUD), however, AWS will often supply student research with monetary credit.\\
