\chapter{Development, Implementation, and Testing}
Model development is focused on obtaining a mathematical expression for modelling the two area power system and the PI controller, in addition to specifying the neural network architectures for experiments. Implementation primarily focuses on the DDPG training algorithm along with Python class implementations for the environment, PI controllers, and neural networks.
