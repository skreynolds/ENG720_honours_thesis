\chapter{Analysis and Discussion}

This chapter provides analysis for both agent training and trained agent performance phases of the simulation experiments. For agent training, this will include the comparison of final and highest MACR100 scores for the different simulation experiments. Explanations are offered where an agent performance is poor. Similarly, a comparison of trained agent performance from the different experiments is provided, as well as a comparison to an optimally trained PI controller. Explanations are offered for instances where trained agent performance does not exceed the tuned PI controller.

\section{Training}
Monotonically increasing cumulative reward values indicate a continuous average increase in deep reinforcement learning agent performance. This is a desirable feature for cumulative reward plots. Plots of the MACR100 evolution for each experiment are detailed in Figures \ref{fig:6201_average_reward}, \ref{fig:6301_average_reward}, \ref{fig:6401_average_reward}, \ref{fig:6501_average_reward}, \ref{fig:6601_average_reward}, \ref{fig:6701_average_reward}, and \ref{fig:6801_average_reward}.

Generally, it can be observed that MACR100 is positively correlated with the episode number for all experiments. It is noted that the MACR100 signals were not monotonic for any experiment. Moreover, the MACR100 plots feature small to large fluctuations in the signal with increase in episode. This is especially true for the neural network experiment, expert learner experiment, and stochastic load demand experiment.

During the early stages of training all experiments demonstrated a period during which rapid learning took place. This is indicated by a steep rise in the MACR100 score, which typically took place in the first 1000 episodes of training, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:7101_MACR100_first}. In all experiments the agents demonstrated policy convergence, as indicated in reduced fluctuations of the MACR100 score. Convergence typically took place after the episode 7000, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:7102_MACR100_second}.

The baseline experiment demonstrated the best MACR100 score at the 10000 episode, and one of the highest MACR100 scorces overall. The exception was the expert learner experiment which yielded a marginally higher score than the baseline during training. Figure \ref{fig:7103_macr100_comparison} provides a comparison of the MACR100 for different experiments at episode 10000. Figure \ref{fig:7104_macr100_comparison} provides a comparison of the highest MACR100 achieved during training for each experiment. The principal observation that can be made from these results is that the original DDPG hyperparameters and neural network architecture used by Lillicrap \textit{et alias} are the best suited to the load frequency control task.

\section{Trained Agent Performance}
The optimally tuned PI controller was able to perform the load frequency control task better than trained agents over each experiment. This was evident across all performance metrics. Despite this short-falling, trained agents were still able to arrest frequency deviations, providing an improvement over a system with no controller. The Baseline experiment demonstrated the best results for most performance metrics; however, the Baseline control policy caused system frequency oscillations, ultimately making it unusable. Control policies observed in the OU Noise and Stochastic Load Demand experiment also performed well, exhibiting more stable control characteristics when compared to the Baseline control policy; however, persistent frequency deviation offsets rendered them unusable. 

The remainder of this chapter discusses the trained agent performance with respect to each of the performance metrics.

\subsection{Cumulative Reward}
The optimally tuned PI controller received a better cumulative reward when compared to all experiments for both the +0.01pu and -0.01pu step change disturbances at the 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 second marks. Figures \ref{fig:7201_cum_reward_pos} and \ref{fig:7202_cum_reward_neg} show the trained agent performance for for +0.01pu and -0.01pu step change disturbances at the 15 sec mark, respectively. The PI benchmark is included as a reference. For the +0.01pu step change disturbance the Baseline experiment performed the best with a cumulative reward marginally worse than the PI controller. The next best agent was the OU Noise experiment. For the -0.01pu step change disturbance the Priority Experience Replay experiment performed the best, closely followed by the Baseline. The worst performing agents were from the Activation Function and the Neural Network experiments.

It is clear that the trained agent cumulative reward performance displays inconsistency across positive and negative step change disturbances. This is evident in both the mismatching of cumulative rewards for +0.01pu and -0.01pu step disturbance scenarios, and also the performance ordering mismatch. This is in contrast to the PI controller, which maintains a consistent cumulative reward for the 15 sec mark in both positive and negative step change disturbance scenarios.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Frequency Deviations}
The optimally tuned PI controller maintained lower average frequency deviations in Areas 1 and 2 when compared to all experiments for both +0.01pu and -0.01pu step change disturbances at the 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 sec marks. Baseline and OU Noise experiments were able to show smaller maximum frequency deviations when compared to the PI controller in some instances. Figure \ref{fig:7203_max_freq} shows a comparison of the maximum frequency deviation of  the trained agents for a +0.01pu step change disturbance at the 15 sec mark, and Figure \ref{fig:7204_avg_freq} shows a comparison of the average frequency deviation for the same scenario. Both figures include the PI benchmark for comparison. The worst performing experiment for both average and maximum frequency deviation was the Activation Function.

Despite the Baseline experiment having the best recorded performance, visual inspection of the frequency signal for Areas 1 and 2 show undesirable frequency oscillations occurring after the step change disturbance, resulting in an unusable policy for load frequency control. Oscillations such as these would cause unnecessary wear on generation units, and contribute to instability in the power system. Frequency control plots for the Baseline experiment are shown in Figures \ref{fig:6202_freq_1} and \ref{fig:6204_freq_2} in \textsection \ref{sec:baseline}.

More stable frequency signals were observed in both the OU Noise and Stochastic Load Demand experiments. 
One way to avoid neural network over fitting for deep reinforcement learning over fitting is to ensure that the 



talk about the best performers - are these visual inspections consistent with the metrics.

there is a stand out performer in the stochastic load demand profile experiment.

Frequency plots for Area 2 given a +0.01pu step change disturbance at the 15 sec mark for all experiments are shown in Figures \ref{fig:6204_freq_2}, \ref{fig:6304_freq_2}, \ref{fig:6404_freq_2}, \ref{fig:6504_freq_2}, \ref{fig:6604_freq_2}, \ref{fig:6704_freq_2}, and \ref{fig:6804_freq_2}.
