\chapter{Conclusion and Future Directions}

Load frequency control is an important part of the power system AGC scheme. Stochastic load demand profiles arising as a result of power consuming appliances being added or removed from the network cause power system frequency changes which utility providers seek to mitigate by modifying power generation in real time. Traditionally this is done using classical control architectures such as PI controllers. The use of alternative control architectures has been explored with useful results being demonstrated for
