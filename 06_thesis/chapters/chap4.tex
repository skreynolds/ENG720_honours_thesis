\chapter{Approach}
This chapter presents the experimental approach which is broken up into two phases, undertaken sequentially. The first phase focuses on development and verification of the software implementations for the power system environment model, controllers, neural network architectures, and training algorithms. The second phase uses the developed models to experimentally assess the performance of using a neural network for load frequency control. The experiments will assess the performance of different neural network architectures, training hyperparameters, combining expert training examples with agent experience, and the use of stochastic load demand profiles.
