\chapter{Approach}
This chapter presents the experimental approach which is broken up into two phases, undertaken sequentially. The first phase focuses on development, implementation, and verification of the software implementations for the power system environment model, controllers, and neural network training algorithms. The second phase uses the developed models to experimentally assess the performance of a neural network for load frequency control using different neural network architectures, hyperparameters, expert training examples, and stochastic load demand profiles.
