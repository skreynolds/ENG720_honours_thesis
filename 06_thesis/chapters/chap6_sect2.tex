\section{Neural Network Architecture Experiments}
The agent was trained for 10000 episodes, as detailed in \textsection \ref{ssec:training}. The evolution of MACR100 over the 10000 episode duration is shown in Figure \ref{fig:6301_average_reward}. The highest MACR100 during training was -66.44 at episode 9720, and the MACR100 at episode 10000 was -102.15.

The trained agent performance was evaluated against a number of scenarios as outlined in \textsection \ref{ssec:testing}. Agent performance evaluation results for the +0.01pu step change disturbance at the 15 sec mark are detailed in Table \ref{tab:6201_pos_15_sec_results}. Results for the remaining performance evaluation scenarios are listed in Tables \ref{tab:A501_baseline_pos_results_2} and \ref{tab:A501_baseline_neg_results_2} in Appendix \ref{app:simulation_results}.

Frequency and control signal plots for a +0.01pu load demand at the 15 sec mark were captured for both power system areas. Frequency plots are shown in Figures \ref{fig:6302_freq_1} and \ref{fig:6304_freq_2}, and control signal plots are shown in Figures \ref{fig:6303_ctl_1} and \ref{fig:6305_ctl_2}.
