\section{Neural Network Controller Model}
Neural network models were developed as per the approach detailed in \textsection \ref{ssec:neural_network_model}. Two Python classes were created: one for the actor called \verb|Actor|, and another for the critic called \verb|Critic|. 

Implementations for the \verb|Actor| and \verb|Critic| classes can be found in Appendices \ref{app:implementation_actor_model} and \ref{app:implementation_critic_model}, respectively.
