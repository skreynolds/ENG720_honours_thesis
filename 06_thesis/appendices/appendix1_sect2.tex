\section{Turbine Model}\label{app:turbine_model}
To develop a turbine model, consider a fossil-fuelled single reheat tandem-compound turbine. A basic configuration of components can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:A03_turbine_configuration}. The derivation and analysis that follows borrows heavily from Kundar \cite{Kundur1994}. Steam enters a high pressure (HP) section through the control valve and the inlet piping. Housing for the control valves is called the steam chest. The HP exhaust steam is passed through the re-heater. Reheat steam flows into the IP turbine section through the reheat intercept valve (IV) and the inlet piping. Crossover piping provides a path for the steam from IP section exhaust to the low pressure (LP) inlet.

Control valve position, $y_E$, modulates the steam flow through the turbine for load/frequency control during normal operation. The response of steam flow to a change in control valve position exhibits a time constant $T_{CH}$ due to the charging time of the steam chest and the inlet piping to the HP section. An intercept valve is normally used for rapid control of the turbine in the event of an overspeed; however, will not be considered in this analysis. The reheater holds a substantial amount of steam making the dynamics of this component slow enough to require its own time constant $T_{RH}$. Steam flowing into the LP sections experiences additional time constant $T_{CO}$ associated with the crossover piping. Figure 2 shows the block diagram representation of the tandem compound reheat turbine \cite{Kundur1994}.

\end{figure}

To simplify the model shown in Figure \ref{fig:A04_turbine_full_block_diagram}, it is assumed that $T_{CO}$ is negligible in comparison to $T_{RH}$. Moreover, the remaining two time constants, $T_{CH}$ and $T_{RH}$, have been combined into a single time constant $T_t$. Hence, the power output of the turbine, $\Delta P_G(s)$, can be linked to the valve position, $\Delta Y_E(s)$, in the frequency domain with the following expression:
\begin{equation}
	\Delta F(s) = \bigg( \frac{K_t}{1 + T_t s} \bigg) \times P_G(s) \label{eq:A10}
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{eq:A10} is a simplified model of the turbine in the frequency domain. The parameter $K_t$ is referred to as the gain of the turbine; and the parameter $T_t$ is referred to as the time constant of the turbine. The block diagram showing this representation can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:A05_turbine_model}.
