\noindent In the desert \\
I saw a creature, naked, bestial, \\
Who, squatting upon the ground, \\
Held his heart in his hands, \\
And ate of it. \\
I said, ``Is it good, friend?'' \\
``It is bitter—bitter,” he answered; \\

\noindent ``But I like it \\
``Because it is bitter, \\
``And because it is my heart.'' \\
