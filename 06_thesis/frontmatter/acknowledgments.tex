\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
I would firstly like to thank my partner Jane who provided me with love, encouragement, and endless support. Thanks to Daniel Gruszecki for your words of motivation, countless hours of discussion, and friendship. You helped me apply a critical lens to this work, and propped me back up when I fell over. Finally, I would like to thank my supervisor Dr. Charles Yeo for his time and support.
